### key points
- Age-specific prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 for developing countries has not been well assessed.
- Seroprevalence in developing countries (as measured by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) is markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity.
- Seroprevalence among older adults is broadly similar to that of younger age-groups.
- Age-specific IFRs in developing countries are roughly twice those of high-income countries.
- Population IFR in developing countries with satisfactory death reporting (based on UN/WHO data as of 2016) is ten times higher than in other developing countries.
- These results underscore the urgency of disseminating vaccines to vulnerable people in developing countries.
