# Highlights
-	Age-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs) of COVID-19 in developing countries are about twice those of high-income countries. 
-	Seroprevalence (as measured by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) is broadly similar across age cohorts, underscoring the challenges of protecting older age groups in developing countries. 
-	Population IFR in developing countries is similar to that of high-income countries, because differences in population age structure are roughly offset by disparities in healthcare access as well as elevated infection rates among older age cohorts.
-	These results underscore the urgency of disseminating vaccines throughout the developing world.
